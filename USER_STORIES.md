# User Stories
## Four to five user stories for each stakeholder:
#### Stakeholder 1 - Market research team
The market research team needs an application that creates data for them that is transparent and accurate because they will be using it to develop new action items for the product team.

#### Stakeholder 2 - Development team
The development team should make a product that is light and efficient and lends itself to a streamlined development process. The technology component of the project needs to have fewer complex parts and clean readable code that could be scaled for future growth.

#### Stakeholder 3 - Focus group participant
Focus group participants will require an application whose use is completely transparent. Their experience of using should include powerful descriptors and cognitive walkthroughs in addition to the photographs. This will ensure a more secure route to conversion at a later date.
