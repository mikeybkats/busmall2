# Instructions
#### Order of operations
1 - user accesses site
2 - site generates objects, content listeners, button on load

4 - keep functions very simple.


- 3 random photos in
- an array of objects
- start by displaying one random photo
- Math.random()   min   max
- min = 0
- array.length minus one
- min = inclusive
- max = exclusive
- wrap it in a for loop to print three times
- generate random number
- if the result of the random is a duplicate then re-roll the random (if/else)(conditional logic)
- use random number to access array of objects
- a particular number chooses a particular object
- decide path value to src attribute
- then load the image
- increment the number of times the image was clicked in the object
- increment the number of times the image was displayed in the object
- name, path, tally, num times displayed
- event.target.id will be the mechanism to collect the tally's
- to turn off a certain action container.removeEventListener();
- to turn on certain actions container.addEventListener();
- operation
